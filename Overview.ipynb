    "## Project Summary and Goals\n",
    "Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) are newly forming stars which are yet to begin burning. They are split into different classes depending on their dust/gas envelope to protostar ratio; Class 0 having the greatest envelope and Class III no longer having an envelope. Due to the different ratios of envelope to protostar, each class appears differently in spectroscopy; thus the difference in fluxes between Spitzer IRAC bands are able to determine which class the data comes from. This project will focus on using the same data as Cornu and Montillaud (2021; CM21) to classify data points into three classes: Class I, Class II, and Contaminants. Only these three classes out of the original 9 available are chosen as Class 0 is too dusty to detect, and Class III is difficult to distinguish from regular stars. Furthermore, the contaminating classes (galaxies, shocks, stars, and PAHs) are of less concern -- we would like the algorithms to focus on distinguishing Class I and Class II from the rest. The original paper uses a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with one hidden layer (20 neurons). Their results are presented in the below table.\n",
    "\n",
    "|Class | Recall | Precision |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "|1 | 94.0% | 79.1 %|\n",
    "|2 | 96.7% | 90.6% | \n",
    "|Other | 98.7%| 99.8%| \n",
    "\n",
    "The data for this project was pulled from https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/647/A116. These data include columns for four Spitzer IRAC bands (3.6 $\\mu m$, 4.5 $\\mu m$, 5.8 $\\mu m$, and 8 $\\mu m$) fluxes and errors, as well as from one Spitzer MIPS band (24 $\\mu m$), along with the target values as determined via a manual classification scheme and the predicted data from CM21. We will only be using the four IRAC bands and their associated errors, as the MIPS band does not provide data for most objects. We use the same target values as they do for accurate comparison. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project seeks to use a multitude of algorithms learned over the semester to measure their effectiveness and compare it to the recreated MLP of CM21. These algorithms include: GridSearch with an SVC, GridSearch with a Logistic Regressor, a Stacking Ensemble with an SVC and a Logistic Regressor, a Gradient Boosting ensemble, a Random Forest ensemble, and an XGBoost ensemble. We also created our own MLP based off of their prescription. The workload was split as follows: B. Crompvoets completed the data cleaning and all other algorithms besides the MLP, and S. Fielder completed an MLP close to that of CM21, as well as creating a custom data loader/split. They communicated together on the best hyper-parameters to test.\n"

Of course when the learning rate is low, the step size for the SGD is so small that it will need quite a bit of time to yield necessary results that are comparable to the paper. From the confusion matrix above, we know that the model at it's early stages does a great job at classifying the \"Others\" class as well as the Class II objects, but the network is not yet picking up the differences between Class I and Class II objects.\n",

The network did improve significantly for recall in Class 2 objects, increasing from around 75% to 94%. This increase in recall was a direct result of lowering the amount of false negatives for Class 2 objects.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Results and Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "In the three images below we summarize the results of recall for each algorithm and our best performing MLP with each different data-split. We see that, if we are focused purely on achieving the best recall for Class I, then the SVM (with the \"300's\" split) is our best algorithm. However if we look across multiple classes, we find that the MLP (with CM21 split) does perform best, followed closely by XGBoost (also with CM21 split). \n",
    "\n",
    "These results indicate that classical ML methods are worth considering, as they give good performance given their simplicity in coding, and also in their implementation time for training (comparably negligible to the neural network). Overall, the justification to use the neural network approach for this problem is it's generalizability. At any point the network can be continued to train on newer data, and perhaps even make predictions on a dataset that is outside of the scope of the original dataset. The simplicity of the model itself, only having one hidden layer with a total of around 240 parameters, means that the network can easily be adapted to train further on an unrelated dataset, and perhaps yield to better predictions overall. We believe that if time is no constraint (which is rarely the case), we would choose the MLP for the overall great accuracy achieved, arriving the closest to the published results given by the CM21 Paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting that CM21 used a simplified, observer-biased, labelling scheme in order to originally label the target data. This scheme and it's associated errors means there is non-negligible probability for falsely labelled data. It is quite likely that the errors in some of our methods are direct results of the incorrectly labelled targets. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, our network and algorithms only made use of eight data columns, not ten as CM21 did. These last two columns are important for separating Class I from reddenned Class II and would hence further aid in the training if they were available. As the data in these columns is sparse, we chose not to use them. To be specific, we would have to choose fill values for the missing entries in the dataset, and we were not confident that we could come up with a perscription that would justify filling in so many values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, one approach that was not taken, would be artificial data augmentation. Since the data set is represented as wavelength measurements with their associated error, there could have been a case made for using some distribution and using small perturbations to create new data that would resemble the prior. This could have helped eleviate the large unbalanced dataset, allowing for the simply approach of splitting the dataset 75/25 to perhaps derive results that were \"on par\" with the other splitting techniques used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, CM21 do suggest that future work with this dataset could utilize their predicted results as the truth labels. This follows from a statement they made, that their network is more accurately predicting the target labels than the simplified labelling scheme originally did."
