### Phase 3
Phase 3 seeks to create networks for both the IRAC and MIPS instruments on board the Spitzer space telescope. The methodology in this phase involves first separating objects into one of three categories: Young Stellar Objects (YSOs), Extra-Galactic sources (EGs), and Stars. A second network then classifies those objects classified as YSOs into further categories of Class I, Flat-Spectrum, Class II, and Class III YSOs.
