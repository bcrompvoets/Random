    "## Project Summary and Goals\n",
    "Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) are newly forming stars which are yet to begin burning. They are split into different classes depending on their dust/gas envelope to protostar ratio; Class 0 having the greatest envelope and Class III no longer having an envelope. Due to the different ratios of envelope to protostar, each class appears differently in spectroscopy; thus the difference in fluxes between Spitzer IRAC bands are able to determine which class the data comes from. This project will focus on using the same data as Cornu and Montillaud (2021; CM21) to classify data points into three classes: Class I, Class II, and Contaminants. Only these three classes out of the original 9 available are chosen as Class 0 is too dusty to detect, and Class III is difficult to distinguish from regular stars. Furthermore, the contaminating classes (galaxies, shocks, stars, and PAHs) are of less concern -- we would like the algorithms to focus on distinguishing Class I and Class II from the rest. The original paper uses a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with one hidden layer (20 neurons). Their results are presented in the below table.\n",
    "\n",
    "|Class | Recall | Precision |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "|1 | 94.0% | 79.1 %|\n",
    "|2 | 96.7% | 90.6% | \n",
    "|Other | 98.7%| 99.8%| \n",
    "\n",
    "The data for this project was pulled from https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/647/A116. These data include columns for four Spitzer IRAC bands (3.6 $\\mu m$, 4.5 $\\mu m$, 5.8 $\\mu m$, and 8 $\\mu m$) fluxes and errors, as well as from one Spitzer MIPS band (24 $\\mu m$), along with the target values as determined via a manual classification scheme and the predicted data from CM21. We will only be using the four IRAC bands and their associated errors, as the MIPS band does not provide data for most objects. We use the same target values as they do for accurate comparison. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project seeks to use a multitude of algorithms learned over the semester to measure their effectiveness and compare it to the recreated MLP of CM21. These algorithms include: GridSearch with an SVC, GridSearch with a Logistic Regressor, a Stacking Ensemble with an SVC and a Logistic Regressor, a Gradient Boosting ensemble, a Random Forest ensemble, and an XGBoost ensemble. We also created our own MLP based off of their prescription. The workload was split as follows: B. Crompvoets completed the data cleaning and all other algorithms besides the MLP, and S. Fielder completed an MLP close to that of CM21, as well as creating a custom data loader/split. They communicated together on the best hyper-parameters to test.\n"
